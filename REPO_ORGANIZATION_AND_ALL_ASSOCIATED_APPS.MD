Security Measures: AI Integration Protection

To ensure that AI-related files and integrations are hidden securely from unauthorized access, the following measures have been applied:
	•	Hidden Directories:
All sensitive AI-related files (such as models, training datasets, and encrypted AI scripts) are stored in hidden directories such as /hidden/ inside the relevant modules. These directories are protected and only accessible by users with specific permissions.
	•	Encrypted Files:
Files within these hidden directories are encrypted using the latest post-quantum cryptographic standards. This prevents unauthorized users from gaining access to AI-related data, even if they are able to locate the directories.
	•	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Only authorized developers and system administrators have access to the hidden directories and encrypted files. The access control system is governed by RBAC, where access rights are assigned based on the developer’s role in the project.
	•	Secure Development Process:
During the development and testing phases, any new AI models or configurations are stored in temporary encrypted storage. Once final integration is completed, the files are removed from temporary storage and moved to the secure hidden directories.
	•	AI Model Obfuscation:
To prevent reverse-engineering of AI models, any model-specific code is obfuscated. This means that even if unauthorized access occurs, the models will be unreadable and non-operational without the proper decryption keys.
	•	Automated Security Audits:
Continuous security audits are carried out across all AI-related files, ensuring that no vulnerabilities exist in the storage or usage of AI data. Additionally, AI model updates are checked for security compliance before being integrated into the main system.

Developers’ Workflow
	1.	Secure Environment Setup:
Developers will work within a secure environment where all AI-related code and models are encrypted, with access controlled by strict permission levels.
	2.	Code Contribution Process:
When contributing code or models related to AI, developers must pass automated security checks and obtain manual approval from the security team before merging their contributions.
	3.	Seamless Development Experience:
Despite these security layers, the development workflow will remain seamless for authorized developers. Hidden directories and encrypted files will be transparent to the development environment, allowing developers to focus on building, testing, and improving the AI models without interference.
	4.	Continuous Integration:
The continuous integration (CI) pipeline will automatically check for any sensitive data being committed and prevent the exposure of AI models or sensitive configurations in public branches or commits.
