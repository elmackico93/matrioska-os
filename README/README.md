Matrioska OS – Repository Organization and Architecture

Matrioska OS is a complex platform composed of an operating system core, modular components (including AI and security features), applications, and infrastructure tooling. To manage this complexity and ensure scalability, the project is divided into multiple Git repositories. Each repository has a well-defined purpose and directory structure, following consistent naming conventions and best practices for access control, CI/CD automation, and integration. This document outlines the repository breakdown, access/security measures, automation pipelines, integration strategy, naming conventions, and a high-level architecture diagram of the Matrioska OS ecosystem.

Repository Breakdown

The Matrioska OS project is organized into several repositories, grouped by function (core OS, modules, applications, infrastructure, etc.) ￼. Each repository contains a clear directory layout for its content (source code, documentation, tests, CI configuration, etc.), and where applicable, uses Git submodules or other linking mechanisms to integrate with other components. Below is a breakdown of each repository, its purpose, and its key contents:

Matrioska OS Core (matrioska-core) – OS Core Platform (Public)

Description:
This repository contains the core of Matrioska OS, including the kernel or core services and fundamental libraries. It provides the base platform on which modules and applications run. The core defines common APIs and interfaces that other components (security, AI, apps) use. It is the heart of the OS, managing resources and orchestrating module interactions.

Directory Structure:
	•	/src/ – Core source code (e.g., kernel logic, system services, core libraries).
	•	/include/ – Public headers or interface definitions for core services (if applicable).
	•	/modules/ – Integrated Modules. Contains references to external module repositories included as submodules (e.g., security and AI modules). For example:
	•	/modules/security/ – (Git Submodule) Matrioska Security module source ￼.
	•	/modules/ai/ – (Git Submodule) Matrioska AI module source.
(Using Git submodules allows the core to include optional components like AI and Security, while those components remain in independent repos. This approach enables modular development, though it should be managed carefully to avoid complexity ￼.)
	•	/docs/ – Documentation for the core (architecture of the core, how to build, usage guidelines).
	•	/tests/ – Core test suite (unit and integration tests for core functionality).
	•	/scripts/ – Utility scripts (build scripts, installation scripts, etc.).
	•	/.github/workflows/ – CI pipeline definitions (GitHub Actions workflows for building the core, running tests, etc.).
	•	/Dockerfile – Optional: Dockerfile to containerize the OS core or its services (if the core can run in a container for testing or deployment).

Integrations:
	•	The core repository includes the Security and AI module repos as submodules under /modules/, ensuring they are versioned alongside the core. This allows building a full distribution from this repo. The core loads or interfaces with these modules via well-defined APIs.
	•	CI/CD integration: changes in this repo trigger builds and tests. If submodule updates (Security/AI) are pulled in, the CI runs integration tests to verify the core plus modules work together. The core’s release pipeline may produce versioned artifacts (e.g., Docker images or binaries) that are consumed by the Infrastructure repo for deployment.

Matrioska Applications (matrioska-apps) – Official Applications (Public)

Description:
This repository contains the official applications and tools that run on Matrioska OS or complement its functionality. These might include user-facing applications, command-line tools, or default services provided with the OS. Separating apps from the core allows them to evolve independently and be optionally included in deployments ￼.

Directory Structure:
	•	/apps/ – Source code for each application, organized in subfolders per app or component. (e.g., /apps/app1/, /apps/app2/ with each app’s codebase).
	•	/libs/ – Shared libraries or common code used by multiple apps (if applicable).
	•	/docs/ – Documentation for the applications (usage guides, developer notes for each app).
	•	/tests/ – Test cases for the applications (each app’s unit tests or end-to-end tests).
	•	/scripts/ – Build and packaging scripts for the applications (for example, to build binaries or container images for each app).
	•	/.github/workflows/ – CI workflows to build/test each application and possibly package them.
	•	/Dockerfile or /docker/ – Dockerfiles for containerizing applications (if the apps are deployed as containers). There might be one per app (named accordingly) if multiple apps exist.

Integrations:
	•	Core Dependency: Applications in this repo depend on the Core (they use the core’s APIs or services). For example, an application might call into the core’s services or use core libraries. This dependency is managed via versioned core libraries or APIs.
	•	Build & Deployment: Each app can be built and deployed independently. CI pipelines produce artifacts (executables or container images) for each application. These artifacts are later deployed by the Infrastructure scripts.
	•	Modular Integration: Apps are loosely coupled – they communicate with the core via stable interfaces (e.g., REST API, CLI, or shared libraries), meaning the core can be updated without breaking apps as long as interfaces remain compatible. Integration tests ensure that new core releases remain compatible with the apps.

Matrioska Security (matrioska-security) – Security Module (Public)

Description:
This repository contains security-focused modules and services for Matrioska OS. It includes features such as authentication/authorization services, encryption libraries, security monitoring, and compliance tools. By isolating security components in a dedicated repo, sensitive security logic can be managed by a focused team and updated on its own schedule, while still integrating tightly with the core OS.

Directory Structure:
	•	/src/ – Security module source code. This could include sub-components like:
	•	auth/ – Authentication and authorization service code (e.g., managing users, roles).
	•	crypto/ – Cryptographic utilities or key management features.
	•	monitoring/ – Intrusion detection, auditing, or security monitoring services.
	•	/docs/ – Documentation for security features (setup guides, threat models, usage).
	•	/tests/ – Tests for security components (unit tests for crypto functions, integration tests for auth flows, etc.).
	•	/configs/ – Configuration files or templates (e.g., default security policies, rule sets).
	•	/scripts/ – Scripts for security tools (database migrations for auth DB, setup scripts).
	•	/.github/workflows/ – CI pipelines (running security tests, linters, etc., and building any deployable security services).
	•	/Dockerfile – Dockerfile to containerize the security service/module if it runs as a separate service (for example, an authentication service container).

Integrations:
	•	The Security repository is integrated into the Core as a submodule (if using the submodule approach) under matrioska-core/modules/security. The core can optionally include or exclude this module in a build. At runtime, the core OS may load the security module as a plugin or communicate with it as an external service, depending on design.
	•	Deployment: If the security component runs as a standalone service (e.g., a security microservice), it will be deployed via the Infrastructure (Kubernetes) as part of the overall system. If it’s a library or plugin, the core includes it in its runtime.
	•	Access Control: This repo likely has stricter review processes given the sensitivity of security code. (See Access & Security below for permission details.)
	•	Updates: Security fixes can be patched here independently of the core. The independent repo allows the security team to apply updates quickly, which can then be pulled into the core as needed (e.g., updating the submodule pointer).

Matrioska AI (matrioska-ai) – AI/ML Module (Public)

Description:
This repository contains the AI modules and machine learning components of Matrioska OS. For example, it might include an AI assistant, predictive analytics services, or machine learning models that enhance the OS’s capabilities. The AI repo is separate to allow specialized development (e.g., data scientists working on models) without interfering with core OS development.

Directory Structure:
	•	/src/ – AI module source code, potentially organized into:
	•	engine/ – Core AI engine or service code (the code that runs AI algorithms or model inference).
	•	models/ – Pre-trained models or scripts to fetch models (large model files might be stored in cloud storage, with pointers or download scripts here).
	•	plugins/ – Any plugins or integrations that hook the AI engine into the core OS (for example, an interface that the core calls to use AI functions).
	•	/docs/ – Documentation for AI features (e.g., how to train models, how the AI features work, user guides for AI-driven functionality).
	•	/tests/ – Tests for AI components (unit tests for ML algorithms, integration tests to ensure the AI service interacts correctly with the core).
	•	/scripts/ – Scripts for ML tasks (data preprocessing, model training pipelines, etc., if applicable, or deployment scripts for AI services).
	•	/.github/workflows/ – CI workflows (to run AI module tests, perhaps to retrain models or verify model integrity, and to build any AI service containers).
	•	/Dockerfile – Dockerfile for containerizing the AI service or modules (allowing the AI component to run in isolation, e.g., a container that serves predictions).

Integrations:
	•	The AI repository is integrated with the Core similarly to the Security repo. In the core’s /modules/ai/ subdirectory, this repo may be included as a submodule, so that the AI features can be packaged with the core release. The core can invoke AI capabilities via a defined interface (for instance, calling an AI service endpoint or linking to an AI library).
	•	Deployment: If the AI module is a separate service (for example, a microservice that the core calls via an API), the Infrastructure will deploy it in the cluster (ensuring it has the necessary GPU/ML runtime if needed). If it’s a library, it will be bundled with core. In either case, containerization is used for consistency across environments.
	•	Data and Model Management: Large ML models or data might be stored outside Git (to keep the repo lean), with this repo containing code to load or retrieve those models. CI could incorporate steps to pull necessary model artifacts for testing or deployment.
	•	Modularity: Keeping AI separate ensures that changes to AI algorithms or models (which might be frequent or experimental) do not destabilize the core. The AI team can iterate rapidly, and once stable, the core can update its submodule reference to include the new AI features.

Matrioska Infrastructure (matrioska-infra) – Infrastructure as Code & Deployment (Private)

Description:
This private repository contains all infrastructure-as-code and deployment configuration for Matrioska OS. It is used by the DevOps/Infrastructure team to provision and manage the environments where Matrioska OS runs. By isolating infrastructure config, we maintain a clear separation of concerns between product code and deployment code ￼. This repo includes Terraform code for cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes manifests (or Helm charts) for deploying the OS components, and any related automation scripts.

Directory Structure:
	•	/terraform/ – Terraform configuration for provisioning cloud resources (e.g., VM clusters, networking, databases). This may be organized into environment-specific directories:
	•	/terraform/envs/ – e.g., dev/, staging/, prod/ with Terraform var files or state config for different deployment environments.
	•	/terraform/modules/ – Reusable Terraform modules for common infrastructure components (to avoid repetition).
	•	/k8s/ (or /helm/) – Kubernetes deployment configurations. This could include:
	•	base/ – Base Kubernetes manifests or helm charts for core components (Deployments/Services for core, AI, security, apps).
	•	overlays/ – Environment-specific overrides if using Kustomize, or Helm values for each environment.
	•	/scripts/ – Deployment scripts or tools (for example, scripts to run terraform apply, or to perform zero-downtime deployments, backup/restore scripts, etc.).
	•	/docs/ – Documentation on how to set up infrastructure, run deployments, and any runbook for operations.
	•	/.github/workflows/ (or Jenkins pipelines) – CI/CD pipelines for infrastructure. For example:
	•	Workflow to plan and apply Terraform changes on merge (with manual approval for production).
	•	Workflow to build and publish Docker images from other repos, or to deploy updated manifests to the cluster (if not done in app repos). (In some cases, the application repos’ CI might directly push images, and this infra repo’s CI focuses on Terraform and cluster ops.)

Integrations:
	•	Terraform Integration: The Terraform code sets up the necessary cloud infrastructure (compute instances, Kubernetes cluster, networking). Using Terraform ensures deployments are consistent and repeatable, following best practices for infrastructure as code ￼. This code is maintained separately since infrastructure might be managed by a different team and follows its own lifecycle ￼ ￼.
	•	Deployment Pipeline: The repo orchestrates deployment of the core, AI, security, and application components onto the provisioned infrastructure. For example, it contains Kubernetes manifests that reference the Docker images produced by the other repos. When a new version of core or a module is released (and its container image pushed), the manifests or Helm charts here are updated (or use image tags passed in via CI) to deploy that new version.
	•	CI/CD: On updates to this repo, a GitHub Actions workflow (or Jenkins job) runs terraform plan/apply to apply infrastructure changes. Another pipeline might deploy the latest app manifests (e.g., using kubectl or Helm to apply changes). Proper gating (manual approval, separate stages for dev/staging/prod) are used for safe infrastructure changes.
	•	Security: This repo is Private because it may contain sensitive information such as infrastructure state, IP addresses, or references to secrets (which are stored securely, not in the repo). Access is limited to the DevOps team. (See Access & Security section for details.)

Matrioska Documentation (matrioska-docs) – Documentation Site (Public)

Description:
This repository holds the comprehensive documentation for Matrioska OS and all sub-projects. While each repository has its own local docs, matrioska-docs serves as the centralized documentation hub (e.g., for a documentation website or knowledge base). It combines user guides, developer guides, API references, and architecture diagrams into a cohesive site. Having a dedicated docs repository allows documentation to be versioned and released independently, and contributors (even non-developers or technical writers) can manage docs without touching core code.

Directory Structure:
	•	/docs/ – Markdown/MDX files for various documentation sections. For instance:
	•	getting-started.md – How to install/use Matrioska OS.
	•	architecture.md – Overview of architecture (could include or link to the architecture diagram of repos and components).
	•	core/ – Core-specific documentation (maybe pulled from matrioska-core/docs).
	•	modules/ – Documentation for AI, Security modules (could be pulled or mirrored from their repos).
	•	apps/ – Documentation for official apps.
	•	/diagrams/ – Architecture diagrams or other images (e.g., PNG/SVG of the global architecture, component interactions). (Binary diagrams can be stored here and referenced in docs. Even though embedding in the README answer is disabled, in the actual repo this is where images would reside.)
	•	/scripts/ – Scripts for documentation site generation (if using a static site generator like Docusaurus, MkDocs, or Sphinx). E.g., a script to convert Markdown to HTML and publish.
	•	/.github/workflows/ – CI workflow to automatically build and deploy the documentation site (for example, deploying to GitHub Pages or an internal docs portal whenever docs are updated on the main branch).

Integrations:
	•	Documentation in this repo is kept in sync with the code. For example, we might use automation to pull in README or reference docs from the code repositories into this docs site. Alternatively, the docs site might just link out to the latest docs in each repo.
	•	The Global Architecture Diagram illustrating repository relationships and system components is stored here (e.g., as an image in /diagrams/) and referenced in architecture.md. This diagram provides a visual map of how the repositories interconnect (see the System Architecture Diagram section below for a textual representation).
	•	Auto-generation: We use tools to auto-generate parts of the documentation. For instance, terraform-docs can generate documentation for Terraform modules ￼, or Doxygen/Sphinx could generate API docs from source comments in the core or modules, and those could be included here. CI ensures these auto-docs are up-to-date.

Access & Security

We distinguish between public and private repositories to balance open collaboration with security. Public repositories (open-source code) allow the community to inspect and contribute to Matrioska OS’s core and modules, whereas Private repositories are used for sensitive infrastructure code or internal configurations. Access to each repo is controlled via role-based permissions:
	•	Public Repos (Open Source): matrioska-core, matrioska-apps, matrioska-security, matrioska-ai, and matrioska-docs are public. This means the source code is visible to everyone. However, only approved team members have direct write access. External contributors can fork and submit pull requests, which the core team reviews. Public repositories invite community contributions while ensuring the core team retains control over what is merged. We enforce contributor guidelines and use protective measures (described below) for quality and security.
	•	Private Repos: matrioska-infra (and any other repo containing sensitive deployment details or proprietary data) is kept private. Only the internal DevOps team and organization members have access. This separation prevents exposure of cloud credentials, IP addresses, or security-sensitive configurations. It also allows internal development on infrastructure without public scrutiny, which might be necessary for security.

Team-Based Access Control:
Within our GitHub Organization (e.g., MatrioskaOrg), we use GitHub Teams to manage permissions for each repository. Each repository or group of repos has an assigned team with the appropriate access level ￼:
	•	Core Team: Maintainers of matrioska-core (and possibly official modules). This team has Write/Maintain access to the core repo and related module repos, allowing them to merge pull requests and manage releases. They follow the principle of least privilege – only core developers are on this team, and they only have the minimal required rights ￼.
	•	Apps Team: Maintainers of matrioska-apps. They have write access to that repo. They coordinate with the Core Team for any interface changes.
	•	Security Team: Security experts with write access to matrioska-security. They may also be given read access to other repos as needed for integration, but write access is limited to security-related code. This team could also be granted a GitHub Security Manager role for the organization, giving them read access to all repos’ security settings ￼ (so they can manage vulnerability reports across the project).
	•	AI Team: ML engineers with write access to matrioska-ai. They focus on AI features and only need to modify AI repo (and propose changes to core if needed for integration interfaces).
	•	DevOps Team: Maintainers of matrioska-infra. They have admin/write access on the infrastructure repo. They may also have write on deployment-related settings. They are kept separate from application code to enforce separation of duties ￼.
	•	Docs Team: Technical writers or developers responsible for matrioska-docs. Write access to documentation repo (and likely read access to all others to pull info as needed).

Roles are assigned such that no single person has unnecessary access to all repos, reducing risk. Organization owners oversee all teams, but day-to-day, each team manages their own repo permissions (again applying least privilege principles) ￼. External collaborators can be added to specific teams if needed (for example, a contractor working only on AI might be added to the AI Team with access only to that repo).

Branch Protection and Code Review:
All repositories (especially public ones) implement branch protection rules on the main/master branch ￼. For example, we require pull request reviews (at least one or two approvals) before merging changes into the main branch ￼. We also require CI checks to pass (tests, linters, etc.) before a merge. This ensures that no unverified code is introduced into critical branches, maintaining stability and security of the codebase. In the security and infrastructure repos, we might enforce even stricter rules (e.g., security changes need approval from a security lead, infrastructure changes require approval from a senior DevOps engineer, etc.).

Secrets Management:
No sensitive secrets (API keys, passwords, cloud credentials) are kept in code. Instead, we use GitHub Actions Secrets and other secret management solutions for CI/CD. For example, the Terraform back-end credentials, or Docker registry passwords, are stored as encrypted secrets in the repo settings (or injected via an external vault) and accessed by CI pipelines securely, never stored in the repository. This prevents accidental leakage of credentials ￼ (the security team periodically audits repos to ensure no secrets are committed).

Security Scanning:
We enable GitHub’s security features on the repositories:
	•	Dependabot Alerts & Updates: Dependabot is activated to alert on vulnerable dependencies and to automatically open upgrade PRs for outdated libraries ￼. This keeps our modules up-to-date with security patches.
	•	Code Scanning: We use GitHub Advanced Security (or third-party CI tools) to scan code for vulnerabilities (e.g., running static analysis, linting for security issues) on a schedule or with each PR.
	•	Secret Scanning: For public repos, GitHub’s secret scanner is on, so if any secret accidentally gets committed, we are notified immediately to invalidate it.

By combining careful access control (public vs private, team roles) with automated security tooling and best practices, we ensure the Matrioska OS repositories are secure and only accessible to the right people. This structure also aligns with the goal that each team can work independently on their component without broad access to others ￼, while still collaborating under the same organization.

Automation (CI/CD Pipeline)

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are set up across all Matrioska OS repositories to automate building, testing, and deploying, which improves reliability and agility ￼ ￼. Each repository has its own pipeline for component-level CI, and we have integration pipelines that bring everything together for releases. We use GitHub Actions as the primary CI/CD platform (given its seamless integration with GitHub repos), with potential use of Jenkins for specialized cases or where self-hosted runners are needed. Key aspects of our CI/CD setup:
	•	Per-Repository Pipelines: Every repo contains CI workflows (as YAML in .github/workflows/). For instance:
	•	Core: On every push or PR, run a pipeline to compile the core, run unit tests, and run integration tests with stub modules. If the core repo’s main branch is updated (after PR merge), a release workflow can build a Docker image or package for the core and push it to a registry (e.g., GitHub Container Registry or Docker Hub).
	•	Apps: Pipelines build each application, run tests (perhaps in parallel for multiple apps), and create application artifacts (binary releases or container images).
	•	Security & AI: Each has its own tests (including any specialized testing, e.g., security repo might run static analyzers, AI repo might run model performance tests). They build their deliverables (for example, a security microservice image, or an AI service image).
	•	Docs: On docs repo updates, a CI job might build the documentation site (and could deploy it to GitHub Pages automatically if changes are on main).
These isolated pipelines ensure that a change in one component is validated on its own, aligning with the idea that each team can build and deploy its service independently ￼.
	•	Continuous Delivery & Integration Testing: While each repo is tested on its own, we also automate integration testing of the entire system. For example, we have a nightly or on-demand pipeline (could reside in a special repo or be triggered via the infra repo) that pulls the latest builds of core, security, AI, and apps, and deploys them together in a staging environment (like a kind of smoke test of the whole OS). This implements the practice of “test entire platform and deploy as one single entity” in addition to per-service tests ￼. We may use a Docker Compose setup or a Kubernetes kind cluster in CI to start all components and run end-to-end tests. This catches any integration issues early. If the integrated tests pass, we know the latest versions of each component are compatible.
	•	Deployment Pipelines: The Infrastructure repo’s CI handles actual deployments. For instance, when changes are merged to matrioska-infra or when a new version of a component is released, a GitHub Actions workflow (or a Jenkins pipeline, if chosen for infra) triggers:
	•	Terraform steps: validate and apply infrastructure changes (e.g., ensure the Kubernetes cluster is up to date). This might target a specific environment (via branch or manual trigger for prod).
	•	Kubernetes deployment steps: update the running cluster with new images of core/app/AI/security. We might tag Docker images with version numbers or Git SHAs, and the infra pipeline will use those tags in the manifests. Deployment strategies like rolling updates are used to avoid downtime. (Using Kubernetes allows us to do rolling updates by default ￼).
	•	If using Jenkins, it might be configured to watch the repos or be triggered via webhook when new images are available, then handle the deployment in a more controlled environment.
	•	Artifact Management: All build artifacts are handled automatically. For example, compiled binaries or packages can be uploaded to GitHub Releases or an artifact repository. Container images are pushed to a container registry. Each repo’s CI is responsible for its artifact: core image, AI image, etc. By decoupling artifact build from deployment, we ensure each piece can be built and tested independently, and then the infra can pull the ready artifacts. Versioning is consistent (we may use a version number across all components for a release, or separate versioning per component and a compatibility matrix documented somewhere).
	•	Automatic Documentation: We integrate docs generation into CI. For instance, if the core has API documentation (comments in code), a CI job can run a tool to generate HTML/markdown from it and push it to the matrioska-docs repo or a documentation website. We also use CI to enforce that documentation is updated – e.g., a check that if public APIs changed, the docs in matrioska-core/docs were updated in the same PR. Similarly, Terraform documentation (using terraform-docs) is generated and updated in the docs site for transparency ￼. This automation reduces manual work and keeps docs in sync with code.
	•	Dependency Management: As mentioned, Dependabot is enabled on repositories to automatically open pull requests for dependency updates ￼ (for example, if matrioska-core uses a library that has a new version, Dependabot will propose an update). CI pipelines run on these PRs to ensure the update doesn’t break anything. This way, we keep libraries up-to-date with minimal human effort, improving security and stability.
	•	Quality Gates: Each pipeline includes stages like linting (coding style checks), static analysis (to catch bugs or security issues), and testing. We treat a failing pipeline as a blocker for merging changes. In addition, code coverage tools might run to ensure tests are covering a good percentage of code. These results can be reported in pull requests for visibility.
	•	Multi-Platform Builds: If Matrioska OS targets multiple platforms (for instance, different CPU architectures or operating environments), our CI uses build matrix strategies (GitHub Actions matrix or Jenkins parallel stages) to test across all targets. For example, building Docker images for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64, or running tests on different OS versions. This ensures broad compatibility of the OS.
	•	Notifications and Logging: The CI/CD system sends notifications to the respective teams (via Slack/Teams or email) on failures or successful deployments. All pipelines are logged and auditable. We also utilize artifacts from CI (like test reports, logs) to troubleshoot when something fails.

In summary, the automation in place aims to achieve a fast, reliable release cycle. By having separate pipelines for each repository, we take advantage of the easier CI/CD management that a multi-repo setup offers ￼. At the same time, we have integrated tests and deployment pipelines to ensure that all the separate pieces work together as a single product. This approach aligns with industry best practices for microservices and modular architectures, where each component is independently buildable and testable, but the end-user sees a unified system.

Integration Best Practices and DevOps Integration

Integrating all the Matrioska OS components into a cohesive system requires following best practices in modular design, containerization, and infrastructure management:
	•	Microservices Architecture & Loose Coupling: Each repository corresponds to a component or service (core, AI service, security service, etc.), akin to a microservices style separation. This “separate repository per service” approach ensures clear boundaries and independence ￼. Components interact via defined interfaces (for example, REST APIs, gRPC, or plugin APIs) rather than internal, hidden calls. This loose coupling means teams can develop and deploy components on different schedules without breaking the system, as long as they honor the interface contracts.
	•	Containerization (Docker): All deployable parts of Matrioska OS are containerized using Docker. Containerization provides a consistent environment for each component, eliminating the “it works on my machine” problem and easing deployment across different hosts. For instance:
	•	The core OS (if it includes long-running services) is built into a Docker image. If Matrioska OS produces a full OS image (e.g., a VM or ISO), that is handled separately, but for cloud deployment we treat core services as containerized applications.
	•	The AI module runs in its own container (with appropriate runtime, maybe Python or GPU support if needed).
	•	The Security service runs in its container.
	•	Applications can each be containerized or grouped into containers as appropriate.
Using Docker ensures each component has all its dependencies packaged and can be rolled out or rolled back easily by swapping container versions. It also enables scaling: we can run multiple instances of the AI or security service if needed by simply starting more containers.
	•	Orchestration (Kubernetes): We use Kubernetes for orchestration of these containers in deployment. Kubernetes is an industry-standard for managing containerized applications at scale, providing features like service discovery, load balancing, self-healing, and rolling updates. Our Infrastructure repo contains the Kubernetes configs (manifests or Helm charts) that define how each component runs: Deployments for each service, Services for networking, config maps/secrets for configuration, etc. By using Kubernetes, we can deploy the entire Matrioska OS stack on a cluster reliably. For example, the CI/CD pipeline might apply a Helm chart that deploys the core, AI, and security containers as a unified application. Rolling update strategy ensures zero-downtime upgrades (update one pod at a time) ￼. Kubernetes also allows us to set resource limits/requests per service, providing isolation (an intensive AI module won’t starve the core service of CPU, for instance).
	•	Infrastructure as Code (Terraform & Cloud Integration): All cloud infrastructure is defined in Terraform scripts in the matrioska-infra repo. This includes VPC/network setup, cluster provisioning (if using a managed K8s service like EKS/AKS/GKE, or setting up VMs if self-managed), and any ancillary services (databases, load balancers, etc.). Using Terraform means the infrastructure configuration is versioned and code-reviewed just like application code, which is a best practice for DevOps ￼. Changes to infra (scaling up nodes, opening a new port, etc.) go through pull requests and CI plan/apply, ensuring visibility and reducing drift between environments. It also allows easy replication of environments (e.g., spinning up a test environment using the same Terraform scripts as production).
	•	Inter-Repository Integration: Since components are in separate repos, integration is achieved through:
	•	Git Submodules/Subtrees: We have employed Git submodules for core to include the modules (AI, Security) for convenience in combined builds. This means that developers working on the core can easily pull in the exact version of AI/Security code that matches the core. While submodules add some complexity, we manage them carefully (documenting how to update them and using stable version tags) ￼. Alternatively, a more advanced approach could use Git subtree or even package management (e.g., treating modules as versioned dependencies), but submodules were chosen for direct integration and transparency of code.
	•	Versioning and Releases: Each repository has its own versioning (semantic versioning). We document compatibility (e.g., Matrioska Core 1.2.0 is compatible with Security module 1.2.x and AI module 1.2.x). When a combined release of Matrioska OS is made, we tag each repo with a release version and update the submodule references in core (or a manifest in the docs) to those tagged versions. This ensures all pieces that go together are clearly linked.
	•	API Contracts: The integration points (for example, how the core calls the AI module) are defined in interface documentation (possibly in core’s docs). We use versioned API contracts, and whenever an interface changes, both sides (provider and consumer) are updated in sync. We might also utilize automated contract testing: e.g., the core’s CI might run a test against a mock AI service that implements the expected API, to ensure the core’s assumptions hold, and vice versa.
	•	Package Registry: In some cases, instead of submodules, a module could be published to a package registry (for example, a Maven/NPM/PyPI package, if languages differ). But given our structure, submodules and container images suffice.
	•	Consistent Development Environment: To make it easy for developers to work across multiple repos, we provide guidelines and scripts. For example, a dev setup script in the docs or core repo can clone all related repos at once (if someone needs the whole set). We also use consistent branching strategies across repos (e.g., all use main for stable, feature branches for dev). This consistency means developers don’t have to context-switch mentally when moving between Matrioska OS components.
	•	Testing Strategy: Each component is tested in isolation, but we also employ integration tests as described. We might use a top-level integration test suite (possibly in the core or a separate testing repo) that is triggered by CI to deploy the whole system (maybe via Docker Compose or ephemeral K8s) and run user-level scenarios. This ensures that the repositories, while separate, do not diverge in a way that breaks the overall product ￼.
	•	Continuous Deployment & Monitoring: Following deployment, we integrate monitoring and logging (this might be configured via the infra repo as well, using tools like Prometheus, ELK stack, etc., though details are beyond the scope of repository structure). The important point is that each service (core, AI, security, apps) will emit logs/metrics, and our deployment includes a way to aggregate these. Alerts can be set if one component fails. This is part of best practices to ensure that once integrated, the system is observable and issues can be traced to the responsible repo/service quickly.
	•	Fallbacks and Independence: If one module is not present or fails, the core should handle it gracefully. For instance, if the AI module is not deployed (perhaps in a minimal installation), the core still runs (just without AI features). This is facilitated by the modular design. Similarly, security module could have a default or stub in core if not loaded. This ensures the OS is not overly dependent on every piece for basic function, which is important for reliability (and allows scaling down or excluding components as needed for certain installations).
	•	Development Workflow Integration: Our integration approach also considers the developer workflow. With multiple repos, it can be challenging to coordinate changes that span repos. To address this, we have guidelines: for example, if a change in the core requires a change in the AI module, the developer should open PRs in both repos and note the cross-dependency. We use labels or links in PRs to indicate such paired changes, and we likely have an integration manager (person or team) to coordinate version bumps. Additionally, we may have a script or CI job that can test a PR of core with a PR of the module together (using branch references) so we can merge them confidently. These processes ensure that even though code is split, our workflow can handle multi-repo changes smoothly.
	•	Repository Interdependency Documentation: We maintain a document (possibly in the matrioska-docs repo or Wiki) that clearly outlines which repositories depend on which. For example: “matrioska-core version X requires matrioska-security version Y.” This, combined with the architecture diagram, helps developers and release managers understand the big picture.

Overall, our integration strategy leverages the benefits of a multi-repo architecture (modularity, independent deployability, team autonomy) while mitigating its challenges through automation and clear practices ￼. By using Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform, we adhere to modern DevOps best practices for deployment and scalability, making the system easier to manage in production. We test not just each piece but the whole, ensuring confidence that Matrioska OS can be delivered as a reliable, cohesive product.

Naming Conventions and Consistency

All repositories and modules in the Matrioska OS project adhere to a consistent naming convention for clarity and discoverability ￼. This consistency ensures that newcomers and team members can easily identify the purpose of each repository at a glance, and automation scripts can predict repository names.
	•	Repository Names: We use lowercase, hyphen-separated names for all repos. Typically, the names are prefixed with matrioska- followed by a short descriptor of the component. For example: matrioska-core, matrioska-security, matrioska-ai, matrioska-apps, matrioska-infra, matrioska-docs. This ties each repo to the Matrioska OS project (the prefix) and indicates its content. The names are descriptive but not overly long ￼. We avoid ambiguous names. In cases where an official project name or codename exists for a component, we include that in the repo name to maintain consistency with documentation and discussion. (For instance, if the AI module is officially called “Matrioska Vision”, the repo could be named matrioska-vision to reflect that, keeping the prefix and general style.)
	•	Directory and File Names: Inside each repository, directories follow a similar slug-case naming. E.g., docs, scripts, tests are all lowercase. Source code folders may follow language conventions (e.g., a Python package might use underscores if required). We strive for names that clearly communicate their role (e.g., auth for authentication code, models for ML models, etc.). Consistency is key – if one repo uses src for source, all do; if one uses tests for tests, all do the same. This standardized structure means that, for example, anyone can assume a /docs folder exists in each repo for documentation, which aids navigation and tooling.
	•	Branch Naming: We use a standard branching strategy. The main development branch is usually named main (or master in legacy contexts, but we use main for new repos). For feature work, we encourage descriptive feature branch names (e.g., feature/login-api) and for bug fixes (fix/memory-leak-issue). Release branches or tags use semantic versioning (e.g., v1.2.0). All repos follow the same versioning scheme to reduce confusion. If we issue combined releases of Matrioska OS, we tag each repo with the release version for traceability.
	•	Tagging and Releases: Tags are prefixed with v and then the version number (e.g., v1.0.0). In the core repo (which might represent the overall product version), a release tag indicates a coordinated release of all components. Other repos also get the corresponding tags if they had changes in that release. If a repo didn’t change for a release, we still may add a tag pointing to the commit used in that release for completeness.
	•	Official Project Names: This document uses generic names for components (Core, Security, AI, etc.), but these should be replaced with the official names decided in project discussions. For example, if the security module is officially called Sentinel, the repository might be named matrioska-sentinel and the docs would refer to the Matrioska Sentinel project. Ensuring that repository names, documentation, and usage of names in code are aligned with official names avoids confusion. We maintain a glossary in the documentation that maps any code-names or short names to official project names for clarity.
	•	CI/CD Identifier Consistency: The naming convention extends to CI pipelines and Docker images. Docker images are named similarly (e.g., matrioska-core:<version> for the core’s container). Kubernetes objects might also use these names (like a Deployment named matrioska-core). This uniform naming makes it easier to script deployments and manage resources, as everything is prefixed consistently.

By following these naming conventions, we achieve a standardized structure across all Matrioska OS repositories ￼. This not only looks organized but also enables tooling and scripts to operate generally. For instance, a documentation generator can assume it can find a README.md and docs/ in each repo. A security audit script can iterate through all repos starting with matrioska-. A team member can guess that the “Infra” repo is likely matrioska-infra without needing to ask. Consistency in naming is a simple yet powerful way to enforce order as the project scales.

System Architecture Diagram (Repository Relationships)

The following is a high-level architecture diagram (in text form) showing the Matrioska OS repositories and how they interconnect and depend on each other. This illustrates the grouping and integration described above:
Matrioska OS (GitHub Organization / Project)
├── matrioska-core (Core OS Platform) 
│   ├── modules/security (submodule -> matrioska-security repository) 
│   └── modules/ai (submodule -> matrioska-ai repository) 
│       (Core integrates Security and AI modules via APIs/plugins)
│
├── matrioska-security (Security Module) 
│   (Provides auth, crypto, security services; integrated into Core or deployed alongside)
│
├── matrioska-ai (AI Module) 
│   (Provides AI services; integrated into Core or deployed alongside)
│
├── matrioska-apps (Applications) 
│   (Uses Core's APIs to provide end-user functionality; optional components)
│
├── matrioska-infra (Infrastructure as Code) 
│   (Deploys Core, Security, AI, and Apps onto cloud/Kubernetes; manages resources)
│
└── matrioska-docs (Documentation) 
    (Contains documentation and diagrams for all above; references each component)

Diagram Explanation:
	•	The Core repository is central (as shown, other components connect to it). It includes the Security and AI repos as submodules (depicted by the indented entries under core). This indicates that those repos are pulled into the core’s codebase for combined builds or releases. The core depends on these modules for extended functionality (hence the arrow of integration from core to those modules), but can also function to a degree without them (modularity).
	•	The Security and AI repositories are standalone in development but are considered part of the core system when deployed. They are shown at the same level as core in the organization structure, meaning they are separate projects, but logically they “plug into” the core (as indicated by the note).
	•	The Applications repo is separate; it uses the core (as denoted by “uses Core’s APIs”). In a visual diagram, we might draw an arrow from Apps to Core to show that dependency. In this text, it’s noted in parentheses. The apps are not required for the core to run, but in a full system, they add value on top of the core.
	•	The Infrastructure repo is depicted as deploying all the components (core, security, AI, apps) to the cloud. In a visual diagram, one might draw arrows from Infra to each of those, or group core+modules+apps under an “environment” box that Infra manages. Here we simply describe that relationship. The infra doesn’t contain the code of core or others, but uses the artifacts (containers, etc.) from them.
	•	The Documentation repo is shown at the bottom, indicating it pulls information from all projects (hence “references each component”). In a real diagram, this might be a different shape (since it’s not a runtime component but an informational one), perhaps with dashed arrows from every other repo to Docs to show that docs are sourced from each. In text, we note that it contains docs for all.

This architecture diagram demonstrates how each repository fits into the overall Matrioska OS project: Core is the foundation, Security/AI modules extend the core, Apps build on the core, Infra ties everything together in deployment, and Docs provides a unified knowledge hub. The relationships (submodules, dependencies, deployment flows) shown ensure that while development is distributed, the end result is an integrated platform.
