## **System Architecture and Integration Strategies**
The integration of the network in Matrioska OS is divided into distinct project phases, which will be developed in parallel to maximize efficiency and operational consistency. Special attention is given to interoperability between the different components of the advanced network, remote connectivity management, and system adaptability to different use conditions.

### **1. Advanced Network: QoS, Firewall, Mesh Network, Infinite Data Connectivity, and Simbox with eSIM**

- **Mesh Network**: The mesh network infrastructure enables decentralized traffic distribution, improving resilience and reducing points of failure. A node self-configuration algorithm will allow intelligent traffic management, optimizing transmission paths to reduce latency and enhance scalability. The implementation of advanced load-balancing protocols will ensure an equitable distribution of network resources, preventing bottlenecks.

- **Infinite Data Connectivity & Simbox with eSIM Technology**: This proprietary technology allows dynamic selection of the best available network, regardless of geographic location, through advanced management of multi-operator connections. The **AI-powered backend** will analyze network conditions and automatically select the optimal connection, ensuring high performance and reduced costs. Additionally, an **automatic failover system** will ensure service continuity even in case of network failures or congestion.

- **Quality of Service (QoS)**: Advanced QoS management will be implemented to prioritize critical traffic, such as real-time voice and video. QoS policies will be dynamic and adaptive, continuously monitoring **latency, jitter, and congestion**, with automatic network resource adjustments to guarantee optimal performance.

- **Advanced Firewall**: To ensure effective protection against cyber threats, the advanced firewall will use an approach **based on behavioral analysis and intelligent traffic filtering**. An **automated incident response system** will be integrated, capable of quickly isolating threats and applying real-time countermeasures. The **advanced logging system** will provide detailed security event analysis, facilitating monitoring and management of protection policies.

### **2. Mobile Dashboard and Software Development Kit (SDK)**

- **Mobile Dashboard**: The mobile management interface will be designed to ensure intuitive and detailed control over network configurations. The dashboard will provide real-time data on network status, notifications for critical events, and tools for personalized QoS and firewall management. Additionally, with a **predictive analysis module powered by artificial intelligence**, the system will be able to provide proactive recommendations to optimize network performance.

- **Software Development Kit (SDK)**: The system will include a complete SDK for developers, featuring APIs for network connection management, dynamic resource configuration, and real-time data analysis. The development kit will be extensively documented and will include **practical examples, advanced debugging tools, and interactive guides** to facilitate integration with third-party applications.

### **3. Continuous Integration and Testing**

To ensure system stability and security, a **continuous testing and optimization cycle** will be implemented based on **Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) techniques**. New features will be tested in simulated and real environments, with evaluations of performance under load, network scalability analysis, and vulnerability tests to ensure maximum security. Resilience tests will be conducted to simulate critical scenarios, such as **connectivity interruptions, cyber-attacks, and hardware failures**, optimizing the system's response under extreme conditions.
