## 🏗 Architecture Overview
SCN follows a **modular microservices-based architecture**, ensuring **high availability, scalability, and security**. The system is designed to work across **on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments**.

### **Core Components:**
1. **Camera Discovery Module**: Scans and identifies IP cameras in the network.
2. **AI Analytics Module**: Processes video streams for facial recognition, ANPR, and anomaly detection.
3. **IoT Integration Layer**: Communicates with smart lighting and other IoT devices.
4. **API Gateway**: Manages authentication, access control, and data exchange.
5. **Web Dashboard**: Provides a real-time UI for users to interact with the system.
6. **Security & Log Auditing**: Tracks all actions, system events, and user interactions.
7. **Remote Connectivity (Satellite & Cloud)**: Ensures secure access from anywhere in the world.
